# OpenPool

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have a more customizable pool automation system than available by popular manufacturers.

## Description
This project is based on the Hayward ProLogic System.  The main board was removed the housing and replaced with OpenPool PCB.  The transformer in the top right of the enclosure was left installed and the wiring dressed and stored.  The existing Relays (G7L Series from Omron) were used to keep driving the pump, light, aux1, and aux2 systems.
